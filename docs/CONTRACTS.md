# Orbit contract index

This is the canonical index of Orbit's accepted behavioral contracts,
ownership boundaries, proof status, and remaining gaps. `AGENTS.md` governs how
agents work, Beads govern authorized changes, and this index records what the
system must preserve.

## Status

- **Planned:** accepted contract with no sufficient implementation evidence
- **Partially proved:** useful evidence exists, but a required behavior,
  integration boundary, review, or decision remains open
- **Proved:** the owning Bead is accepted and the listed immutable revision and
  checks cover the contract
- **Retired:** the user explicitly replaced or removed the contract; its ID is
  never reused

Accepted ORBS v7 changes ORB-C8 and preserves the ORBS-carried behavior of
ORB-C3 through ORB-C7, ORB-C9, and ORB-C11 at
`baf8aa28dcaa50484cd221aa7730defedc2356bb`.

Accepted exact-version ORBS v8 changes ORB-C9 from client-resolved cells to
Orbit-resolved pointer gestures at
`d9b22eb294f8f42b4f49324fd5467eab239c2917`. It preserves every other ORBS v7
contract and has no compatibility window.

Accepted exact-version ORBS v9 changes ORB-C5 and ORB-C9 so Orbit routes one
left-pointer sequence from authoritative terminal mouse state and tags host
selection copy destinations at
`aed0bcb7e9ad08c8e3e086c7dad0a0eb3ef16672`. It intentionally replaces ORBS
v8 without a compatibility window; current exact consumers use superseding
ORBS v10.

Accepted exact-version ORBS v10 hardens ORB-C9 so an accepted Finish reports
the authoritative presentation revision at sequence completion at
`59975e9176f5caf8b78dc3273e88d9ecbb75dc3f`. It intentionally replaces ORBS v9
without an adapter or compatibility window and preserves the ORBS-carried
behavior of ORB-C3 through ORB-C8 and ORB-C11.

Accepted Orbit `70861097a825c2fbfaea53a8ca9437f45e8602eb` hardens ORB-C9
under unchanged ORBS v10 by superseding wholly unsent host-selection frames.
It preserves every other accepted Orbit contract and the exact wire bytes.

Accepted Orbit `4e03fe280a714c3f3e29d31d0ec6374eaaf4ecea` changes ORB-C8
under unchanged ORBS v10 so lagging relative preview and signed-scroll requests
resolve against current authoritative terminal state. It preserves every other
accepted Orbit contract and the exact wire bytes.

Accepted Orbit `a65e199e16e97330175e314cacf791fa00f53069` hardens ORB-C7
and ORB-C8 so one partially transmitted maximum frame cannot falsely exhaust
the fixed capacity required by one atomic maximum scroll outcome. The wire and
replacement order remain unchanged.

Accepted Orbit `64b225eb249490c9075894814942652a8b9d6192` changes ORB-C8
under unchanged ORBS v10 so one relative preview or signed-scroll request held
during DEC 2026 synchronized output resolves after normal or watchdog release.
It preserves every other accepted Orbit contract and the exact wire bytes.

Accepted Orbit `61c1dc0bc4c9fc3b592058ff8fa5f6cd7b957046` changes ORB-C9
under unchanged ORBS v10 so compatible PTY output preserves active host
selection and repeat-click classification through libghostty-tracked content
movement. It preserves every other accepted Orbit contract and the exact wire
bytes.

## ORB-C1 — Session survival across client loss

- **Status:** Proved
- **Consumer:** One local graphical client attached to a running Orbit Session.
- **Trigger:** The client disconnects and a later client attaches.
- **Result:**
  - The PTY and foreground process remain live while Orbit remains running.
  - The later client reaches the same live Session.
- **Important failures:** Transient Linux PTY close/reopen and simultaneous stale
  socket claims recover or fail explicitly without losing the reachable owner.
- **Owner:** Orbit's concrete runtime coordinator with the isolated platform PTY
  lifecycle.
- **Boundary:** Persistence across Orbit or machine restart is excluded.
- **Proof:** `d96fff2015cded947c881c454216c6bf0ad69b7b`
  - **Environment:** x86_64 Linux
  - **Evidence:**

    - [`simultaneous_stale_socket_claim_has_one_reachable_owner`](../tests/lifecycle.rs)
    - Canonical Rust verification suite

## ORB-C2 — Sole terminal-state authority

- **Status:** Proved
- **Consumer:** Every Orbit runtime and attached client.
- **Trigger:** PTY bytes, client interaction, or terminal-generated responses
  change terminal state.
- **Result:** Orbit alone owns libghostty terminal state and alone sends
  terminal-generated responses to the PTY.
- **Important failures:** Client failure cannot duplicate a terminal response or
  transfer parser authority.
- **Owner:** Orbit's platform-neutral concrete runtime coordinator.
- **Boundary:** Ordered client-visible effects beyond the current transport
  contract remain unproved.
- **Proof:** `d96fff2015cded947c881c454216c6bf0ad69b7b`
  - **Environment:** x86_64 Linux
  - **Evidence:**

    - [`conformance_c2_parser_state_and_terminal_replies_survive_client_failure`](../tests/lifecycle.rs)
    - Canonical Rust verification suite

## ORB-C3 — Bounded interactive and metadata attachment

- **Status:** Proved
- **Consumer:** One local input-capable client and one local read-only metadata
  observer.
- **Trigger:** A peer negotiates an explicit role on the private presentation
  endpoint.
- **Result:**
  - One client may own input while one observer receives only initial and changed
    terminal-authored title, raw working directory, presentation revision, and
    lifecycle.
  - The observer cannot send terminal, presentation, process, or lifecycle
    mutations.
- **Important failures:** Excess roles, incompatible or malformed peers, slow
  readers, disconnect, and exit fail deterministically without disturbing the
  PTY, child, other role, or cleanup.
- **Owner:** Orbit attachment transport and runtime coordinator with canonical
  `orbit-protocol` ORBS v7.
- **Consumes:** Canonical ORBS v7; Venus
  `f13dc7ac2e9a24c5cff5bb7e618436783ec76dbf` and Eon
  `b44d968e38474fc5b75a41bcde2ad750da0d1e3e` adopted that exact version,
  while current consumers use superseding ORBS v10.
- **Boundary:** Visible text observation, agent observation, multiple observers,
  multiple interactive clients, remote access, and process authority are
  excluded.
- **Proof:** `baf8aa28dcaa50484cd221aa7730defedc2356bb`
  - **Environment:** x86_64 Linux
  - **Evidence:**
    - [`metadata_observer_is_read_only_and_keeps_only_the_latest_change`](../src/attachment.rs)
    - [`metadata_observer_streams_inactive_title_and_cwd_without_owning_input`](../tests/lifecycle.rs)
    - Canonical Rust verification suite

## ORB-C4 — Coherent ordered presentation

- **Status:** Proved
- **Consumer:** One attached exact-version presentation client.
- **Trigger:** Attachment begins or authoritative terminal state changes.
- **Result:** Attachment starts with one complete frame at revision N and then
  receives strictly ordered later complete-frame revisions with no stale final
  presentation.
- **Important failures:** Split or synchronized output and a slow reader cannot
  publish partial state or violate final convergence.
- **Owner:** Orbit attachment transport and synchronized runtime publication
  with canonical session and complete-frame codecs.
- **Consumes:** Canonical ORBF v1 in ORBS v7.
- **Boundary:** Native presentation quality remains Venus-owned.
- **Proof:** `baf8aa28dcaa50484cd221aa7730defedc2356bb`
  - **Environment:** x86_64 Linux
  - **Evidence:**
    - [`synchronized_presentation_coalesces_defers_and_times_out`](../src/runtime.rs)
    - [`real_pty_synchronized_output_holds_split_large_update`](../src/presentation.rs)
    - [`conformance_c4_real_pty_reattach_converges_through_complete_ordered_frames`](../src/presentation.rs)

## ORB-C5 — Semantic terminal interaction

- **Status:** Proved
- **Consumer:** Attached clients sending key, mouse, focus, paste, or resize
  interaction.
- **Trigger:** Orbit accepts one canonical semantic input message or begins one
  revision-bound left-pointer sequence.
- **Result:**
  - Orbit encodes terminal interaction against its authoritative terminal
    state.
  - When mouse tracking is active and Shift is absent, Orbit pins the
    left-pointer sequence to terminal input and encodes each positional phase
    once through its existing terminal-aware mouse encoder.
  - Otherwise Orbit pins the sequence to host selection; Shift always selects
    host text.
- **Important failures:** Invalid or terminal-forbidden input fails without
  fallback text or duplicate insertion. Invalid phase order, pressure, cancel,
  endpoint loss, or a terminal-mode change cannot switch an active sequence,
  emit partial input, or synthesize terminal input.
- **Owner:** Canonical platform-neutral `orbit-protocol` values and Orbit's
  semantic interaction owner.
- **Consumes:** Canonical ORBS v9 semantic input; Venus
  `1034817bbe2352fb4b1026bce6b1f02eedd67e37` and Eon
  `df8e07462a8faf548b1afde89b77b96b8095b194` consume the preserved behavior
  through exact ORBS v10.
- **Boundary:** Candidate-list IME and native input quality remain Venus-owned.
- **Proof:** `aed0bcb7e9ad08c8e3e086c7dad0a0eb3ef16672`
  - **Environment:** x86_64 Linux
  - **Evidence:**
    - [`kitty_release_never_falls_back_to_text`](../src/interaction.rs)
    - Accepted real-PTY semantic-input lifecycle checks
    - [`authoritative_left_pointer_route_is_pinned_and_shift_selects`](../src/interaction.rs)

## ORB-C6 — Rich presentation without silent degradation

- **Status:** Proved
- **Consumer:** Every canonical presentation client.
- **Trigger:** Orbit extracts or encodes terminal presentation state.
- **Result:** The boundary carries rich terminal state or explicitly declares an
  unsupported capability; it never silently collapses to a plain-text grid.
- **Important failures:** Malformed cell-width topology fails at every admission
  boundary.
- **Owner:** Orbit's authoritative extraction and synchronized publication with
  canonical `orbit-protocol` values and codecs.
- **Consumes:** Canonical ORBF v1 in ORBS v7.
- **Boundary:** Kitty graphics remain explicitly unsupported in version 1.
- **Proof:** `baf8aa28dcaa50484cd221aa7730defedc2356bb`
  - **Environment:** x86_64 Linux
  - **Evidence:**
    - [`conformance_c6_direct_rows_match_rich_canonical_frame_rows`](../src/presentation.rs)
    - [`orbf_v1_cell_width_topology_is_validated_at_every_acceptance_boundary`](../crates/protocol/src/lib.rs)
    - Canonical ORBF-in-ORBS codec checks

## ORB-C7 — Bounded attachment pressure

- **Status:** Proved
- **Consumer:** Interactive attachments and metadata observers.
- **Trigger:** A client reads slowly, breaks, or disconnects while Orbit continues
  processing PTY state.
- **Result:** Authoritative PTY processing, the other role, and cleanup remain
  live with bounded output buffering and history. One partially transmitted
  maximum frame still leaves bounded capacity for one atomic maximum scroll
  outcome.
- **Important failures:** Pressure disconnects the failing client instead of
  blocking the owner loop or admitting a partial result.
- **Owner:** Orbit attachment transport in the concrete runtime coordinator.
- **Boundary:** The proof covers one local input client plus one metadata
  observer.
- **Proof:** `a65e199e16e97330175e314cacf791fa00f53069`
  - **Environment:** x86_64 Linux
  - **Evidence:**
    - [`pending_presentations_keep_scroll_outcomes_and_latest_replaceable_revision`](../src/attachment.rs)
    - [`authoritative_viewport_survives_detach_and_slow_reader_pressure`](../tests/lifecycle.rs)
    - [`metadata_observer_streams_inactive_title_and_cwd_without_owning_input`](../tests/lifecycle.rs)

## ORB-C8 — Retained history and authoritative scrolling

- **Status:** Proved
- **Consumer:** One healthy exact-version attached client.
- **Trigger:** The client previews or commits relative vertical movement from a
  complete-frame revision it has presented; PTY output may advance Orbit before
  the request is handled.
- **Result:**
  - Each Session configures libghostty with a 16 MiB primary-history byte budget;
    retained rows are content-dependent and the active viewport may exceed it.
  - Preview returns up to one active viewport of canonical rows, nearest first
    in the requested direction, without mutation, and names the current
    authoritative revision whose state it inspected.
  - Commit accepts a nonzero signed distance from -1,024 through 1,024 rows,
    resolves it against current authoritative terminal state, applies it once,
    clears active selection, advances authority once, and returns requested and
    applied rows, one authoritative frame, and the next bounded row window or
    edge.
  - During DEC 2026 synchronized output, Orbit holds at most one unresolved
    preview or commit until DEC 2026 ends or the existing one-second watchdog
    fires. Orbit then re-evaluates authoritative routing and resolves the
    request once without exposing partial state.
  - Negative movement goes toward older history, positive movement goes toward
    the live area, and movement clamps at history boundaries.
  - A successful semantic key that emits PTY bytes returns primary history to
    the live area; detach does not transfer, reconstruct, or reset viewport
    ownership.
- **Important failures:**
  - Terminal-owned mouse tracking or alternate-screen mode 1007 returns
    terminal-owned without PTY input, mutation, or revision advance.
  - Future authority, a second unresolved request, malformed or out-of-range
    distance, and pressure fail before mutation. Lagging relative preview and
    scroll revisions resolve against current authority; stale selection and
    unrelated coordinate- or phase-bound input remain strict.
- **Owner:** Orbit's semantic interaction and synchronized-presentation owners
  with libghostty's native viewport, byte-budgeted history, one canonical row
  extractor, and bounded output queue.
- **Consumes:** Canonical ORBS v10 with unchanged bytes and values; Venus
  `7f325a31d0052d84a1a09ff065c0e9103563c0e8` and Eon
  `e1a5a9e02f7102cef48b25a83f740ea716647fa1` consume exact Orbit
  `64b225eb249490c9075894814942652a8b9d6192`.
- **Boundary:** Arbitrary line-count guarantees, pixels, gesture phase, velocity,
  kinetic effects, graphics, and restart persistence are excluded; physical
  wheels retain their existing typed terminal-routed or one-row behavior.
- **Proof:** `64b225eb249490c9075894814942652a8b9d6192`
  - **Environment:** x86_64 Linux and the Nix-installed Eon composition
  - **Evidence:**
    - [`vertical_scroll_batches_are_bounded_and_canonical`](../crates/protocol/src/session/tests.rs)
    - [`pending_presentations_keep_scroll_outcomes_and_latest_replaceable_revision`](../src/attachment.rs)
    - [`conformance_c8_signed_scroll_batch_is_atomic_bounded_and_authoritative`](../src/interaction.rs)
    - [`authoritative_viewport_survives_detach_and_slow_reader_pressure`](../tests/lifecycle.rs)
    - [`real_pty_synchronized_output_holds_split_large_update`](../src/presentation.rs)
    - Eon `e1a5a9e02f7102cef48b25a83f740ea716647fa1` refreshed profile
      `/nix/store/f46g210pffvzlyix6nv0rh3dsl5arv5m-eon-0.1.0` and passed the
      same split real-PTY regression against its installed Orbit binary.

## ORB-C9 — Authoritative bounded selection and copy

- **Status:** Partially proved
- **Consumer:** One healthy exact-version ORBS v10 attachment.
- **Trigger:** The client begins, updates, finishes, cancels, or copies one
  left-pointer sequence using bounded surface coordinates and current modifiers;
  Begin names the exact current frame revision and a monotonic press timestamp.
- **Result:**
  - Orbit chooses host selection when authoritative terminal mouse tracking is
    absent or Shift is present, and keeps that route through Finish or Cancel.
  - Orbit alone resolves pointer positions, click repetition, cell, word, and
    logical-line boundaries, selected presentation, and copied text through
    libghostty's default gesture behavior.
  - One press-drag selects cells, two select words, and three select logical
    lines; the repeat distance is one cell width and the repeat interval is 500
    milliseconds.
  - Release freezes one bounded plain-text value that later output, resize,
    reflow, or screen transition cannot reinterpret or erase, and returns it
    for the semantic selection clipboard. Explicit Copy returns the same frozen
    text for the ordinary clipboard.
  - An accepted Finish returns one ordered typed completion naming the
    authoritative presentation revision at sequence completion. A client may
    send another press immediately when it already presented that revision;
    otherwise it waits for the exact frame.
  - Orbit discards wholly unsent presentation frames from earlier host drag
    phases before publishing the current phase, so release cannot replay an
    obsolete selection-frame backlog.
  - Compatible PTY output preserves an active host gesture, repeat-click
    classification, and libghostty-tracked selection as content moves, including
    into scrollback. Output that newly enables terminal mouse tracking or leaves
    no valid tracked gesture anchor, including on a different active screen,
    clears the active host selection and resets gesture state; read-only preview
    does not.
  - An ordered client cancel resets an abandoned gesture and clears its partial
    selected presentation without producing copied text.
  - A newer valid press replaces prior selected presentation and frozen text;
    client loss or exit clears them without resetting the ORB-C8 viewport.
- **Important failures:**
  - A backwards press timestamp safely starts a new single-click sequence.
  - Stale revisions, invalid surface coordinates or phase order, formatting
    overflow, pressure, focus loss, or pointer capture loss reject or explicitly
    cancel the gesture without partial state, text, mixed routing, or invented
    terminal input.
  - Synchronized output may defer a host Finish frame or a terminal Begin frame
    that clears prior host selection; the completion preserves the exact held
    revision until presentation resumes or the attachment ends.
  - Selection work and buffering remain bounded and cannot block authoritative
    PTY processing or cleanup.
  - A partially written frame remains ordered and completes before a newer
    selection frame.
- **Owner:** Orbit's semantic interaction owner with authoritative mouse modes,
  libghostty current-viewport gesture selection, and canonical ORBS v10. Venus
  owns native event delivery and clipboard effects.
- **Consumes:** Canonical ORBS v10 and ORB-C7 bounded-pressure behavior; accepted
  ORBS v9 remains the prior routing and host-selection proof. Venus
  `1034817bbe2352fb4b1026bce6b1f02eedd67e37` and Eon
  `df8e07462a8faf548b1afde89b77b96b8095b194` consume this behavior through
  exact ORBS v10.
- **Boundary:** Custom word separators or click
  thresholds, block selection, autoscroll, semantic command-output selection,
  search, graphics, and restart persistence are excluded.
- **Proof:** `61c1dc0bc4c9fc3b592058ff8fa5f6cd7b957046`
  - **Environment:** x86_64 Linux
  - **Evidence:**
    - [`authoritative_selection_rejects_stale_input_and_freezes_copy`](../src/interaction.rs)
    - [`active_selection_tracks_scrolling_pty_output`](../src/interaction.rs)
    - [`authoritative_selection_uses_libghostty_click_and_drag_granularity`](../src/interaction.rs)
    - [`authoritative_left_pointer_route_is_pinned_and_shift_selects`](../src/interaction.rs)
    - [`host_selection_supersedes_unpresented_drag_frames_before_release`](../src/interaction.rs)
    - [`conformance_c9_selection_copy_is_authoritative_bounded_and_client_scoped`](../tests/lifecycle.rs)
- **Open proof:** Exact Venus and Eon adoption plus native Wayland dogfood remain
  required before the compatible-live-output behavior can be promoted to
  `Proved`.

## ORB-C10 — Eon terminal identity

- **Status:** Proved
- **Consumer:** Every Orbit-owned PTY child and its launch environment.
- **Trigger:** Orbit launches a PTY child.
- **Result:** The child receives `TERM=eon` and `COLORTERM=truecolor`; the launch
  environment supplies the repository-owned compiled `eon` terminfo entry
  inheriting `xterm-256color`, so lookup and `clear` succeed.
- **Important failures:** Missing or invalid terminfo is exposed by lookup and
  real-PTY behavior checks rather than hidden by a fallback identity.
- **Owner:** Orbit's platform PTY seam and
  [`terminfo/eon.terminfo`](../terminfo/eon.terminfo); Eon installs the entry.
- **Boundary:** Other distribution formats remain outside the Nix alpha.
- **Proof:** `7f067b30e97d0b4787a7c6c0bbe3dd8a80a61c2c`
  - **Environment:** x86_64 Linux Nix alpha
  - **Evidence:** `orb-j0m.6` isolated `tic`, `infocmp`, real-PTY `TERM`, `clear`,
    and post-clear checks; Eon composition proof
    `eae70e8d3ed4348b389f320dfd49d7db29478546`

## ORB-C11 — Ordered terminal-authored clipboard writes

- **Status:** Proved
- **Consumer:** One healthy ORBS v7 attachment and its native clipboard owner.
- **Trigger:** The terminal emits one clipboard write with exactly one nonempty
  UTF-8 `text/plain` representation.
- **Result:** Orbit transports the normalized standard, selection, or primary
  destination once and in order before the complete frame from the same PTY
  turn; Orbit owns interpretation and transport while the client owns native
  policy and delivery.
- **Important failures:** Invalid UTF-8 or NUL text, clears, unsupported
  representations, payloads above 1 MiB, detached writes, and bounded pressure
  fail without retention, replay, or silent coalescing; pressure disconnects the
  client.
- **Owner:** Orbit attachment transport and concrete runtime clipboard
  interpretation with libghostty normalized effects and canonical ORBS v7.
- **Consumes:** Canonical ORBS v7.
- **Boundary:** Ordinary clipboard delivery, Wayland without data-control,
  broader compositors, and non-Linux policy remain unproved.
- **Proof:** `baf8aa28dcaa50484cd221aa7730defedc2356bb`
  - **Environment:** x86_64 Linux Wayland primary-selection consumer
  - **Evidence:**
    - [`src/attachment.rs`](../src/attachment.rs) ordered bounded output checks
    - `orb-ll1.1` codec, callback, pressure, and real-PTY ordered-effect checks

## ORB-C12 — Bounded Session shutdown

- **Status:** Proved
- **Consumer:** Orbit lifecycle signals and canonical management Stop.
- **Trigger:** Orbit accepts SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, or management Stop after
  launching one PTY Session.
- **Result:**
  - Orbit succeeds only after reaping its direct PTY child.
  - An already-exited child is reaped without signaling a recyclable PID.
  - Otherwise Orbit sends SIGHUP to the initial PTY process group and, when
    distinct and available, the terminal's current foreground process group,
    then gives the direct child up to 500 ms to exit.
  - If the child remains unreaped, Orbit SIGKILLs its still-stable initial group
    and rereads the current foreground group before escalation. If the child
    exits during grace, Orbit sends no later signal to a cached foreground-group
    number.
  - After escalation, Orbit requires the direct child to be reaped within two
    seconds.
- **Important failures:**
  - An already-gone signal target is benign; every other signaling or reaping
    failure is bounded non-success.
  - PID reuse, foreground-group changes, child exit during grace, and writing
    descendants cannot cause delayed signaling or unbounded server lifetime.
  - Client disconnection remains the non-destructive ORB-C1 detach path.
- **Owner:** Orbit's concrete runtime coordinator owns graceful timing,
  escalation, direct-child reaping, and result truth; Linux PTY and process-group
  mechanics stay in the platform seam.
- **Boundary:**
  - Deliberately detached processes, non-foreground groups outside the initial
    group, and SIGHUP-ignoring foreground jobs whose shell exits during grace may
    survive.
  - Orbit scans no process names, ancestry, session IDs, or procfs and claims no
    whole-descendant cleanup. macOS remains unproved.
- **Proof:** `7de9980ffbd6417758698d5c33356204eeb24de5`
  - **Environment:** x86_64 Linux
  - **Evidence:**
    - [`shutdown_hups_the_unreaped_direct_child`](../tests/lifecycle.rs)
    - [`shutdown_escalates_foreground_and_permits_a_detached_process`](../tests/lifecycle.rs)
    - [`stale_socket_and_safe_signal_shutdown`](../tests/lifecycle.rs)
    - [`writing_descendant_cannot_hold_server_open_after_known_child_exit`](../tests/lifecycle.rs)
    - Eon `ced9e4ae11ed21a0f05d50cd470491adffa73b54` consumes this shutdown
      boundary; composed recovery and Stop acceptance is recorded at Eon
      `0bf0b165d06b4a8162be497011070f61f6c2000a`.

## ORB-C13 — Same-boot management ownership

- **Status:** Proved
- **Consumer:** One local Eon launcher and one later replacement on the same boot
  and login.
- **Trigger:** A launcher prepares an owned mode-0600 record, Orbit crosses Ready,
  the original supervisor disappears, or a replacement acquires management.
- **Result:**
  - The launcher may retain an empty exact owned mode-0600 record inode before
    spawn. Orbit serializes Ready by attempting one exclusive lock; a held claim
    stops startup without marking or publishing.
  - After winning, Orbit revalidates and marks the retained inode, then
    atomically replaces its pathname with the canonical live record.
  - Only a launcher winning the still-empty retained inode may use pre-Ready
    local-child rollback.
  - After Ready, supervisor loss does not stop or hold open the Orbit run.
  - One replacement may acquire the sole private management lease only after a
    live handshake matches:
    - the bounded logical Session ID and fresh run ID;
    - the exact record plus component and management generations;
    - Orbit PID and start identity, both endpoint identities, and expected peer
      UID.
  - Files and process metadata locate or corroborate a candidate but never
    authorize attach or Stop.
  - Lease disconnect before Stop is non-destructive. Two replacements produce
    one winner and one Busy loser; accepted Stop is not cancelled by disconnect.
  - Management carries only bounded identity, live status, and explicit Stop,
    with one request and response in flight.
  - Canonical ORBS remains a separate one-input-client plus
    one-metadata-observer boundary retaining ORB-C1 through ORB-C11.
  - Stop succeeds only through the validated lease after ORB-C12 succeeds.
  - Natural child exit and successful Stop atomically replace the live record
    with one non-authoritative terminal tombstone containing termination reason
    and exact exit-code-or-signal outcome, then remove only exact endpoints.
- **Important failures:**
  - Validation or transport failure authorizes no PID, process group, process
    name, pathname, procfs scan, cgroup, or pidfd fallback.
  - Bounds are explicit:
    - Eon start and recovery: five seconds;
    - Orbit incomplete handshake: one second;
    - each management message and record: 4 KiB;
    - each identity: 128 UTF-8 bytes;
    - failure detail: 1 KiB.
  - Runtime directories must be exact UID-owned mode-0700 directories; sockets
    and regular records must be exact UID-owned mode-0600 objects.
  - Symlinks, unexpected types, wrong ownership or mode, replacement, overflow,
    malformed or incompatible state, and slow peers fail closed without blocking
    PTY, presentation, child observation, or shutdown.
- **Owner:** Orbit's private management owner and canonical protocol package;
  Linux mechanics remain isolated, while Eon owns consumer policy.
- **Consumes:** Canonical management v1 and ORB-C12.
- **Boundary:**
  - The contract is per live Orbit run. Eon retains topology, enumeration,
    cleanup, and recovery policy.
  - No workspace topology, retained log, Orbit or machine restart, logout or
    reboot survival, multiplayer, remote access, public protocol,
    service-manager requirement, or same-UID sandbox is promised.
  - Platform-neutral identity, lease, status, and failure values use isolated
    Linux spawn/stdio, peer-credential, process/start-identity, endpoint,
    permission, and polling mechanics. Linux is first and macOS remains
    unproved.
- **Proof:** `7de9980ffbd6417758698d5c33356204eeb24de5`

## Focused terminal conformance corpus

The current corpus groups six accepted `orb-8s0` tests and the accepted x12
test under one offline, headless command without copying their stimuli or
expectations:

```sh
cargo test --locked conformance_
```

The command runs the pinned `libghostty-vt` 0.2.1 path backed by Ghostty
`a887df42c56f6de86c0fe6da9c4eeca37931e083`. Protocol-only checks remain in
the normal suite because they do not exercise that terminal engine.

| Case | Stimulus | Orbit-visible observation | Assertion policy | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `conformance_c2_parser_state_and_terminal_replies_survive_client_failure` | Split DEC 1049 input across client loss, then cursor visibility and position query | The authoritative parser completes the alternate-screen transition, emits one PTY response, and later restores primary | Exact reply bytes and single emission; semantic screen and cursor state | `ORB-C2` |
| `conformance_c4_real_pty_reattach_converges_through_complete_ordered_frames` | Primary pending wrap, rich alternate screen, resize, detach under continuous output, responsive semantic interrupt, then split CSI, UTF-8, and APC tails | Reattachment starts at the complete current frame; later revisions strictly increase and converge on the final primary state | Exact reattached-frame equality and revision order; semantic final convergence | `ORB-C4` |
| `conformance_c5_authoritative_input_modes_and_resize_survive_detach` | Resize plus key, mouse, focus, paste, Kitty-keyboard, mode change, and reattach | The PTY receives terminal-state-aware input once and retains the requested dimensions | Exact PTY bytes and `stty` dimensions | `ORB-C5` |
| `conformance_c6_direct_rows_match_rich_canonical_frame_rows` | Wrapped styled text, RGB and palette colors, hyperlink, protection, combining and wide graphemes, viewport movement, and resize | Direct row extraction equals the corresponding canonical frame rows before and after reflow | Exact canonical-row equality; semantic presence of accepted rich fields and width roles | `ORB-C6` |
| `conformance_c8_authoritative_viewport_routes_wheel_and_key_from_terminal_state` | Preview and wheel at history edges, mouse tracking, alternate screen, synchronized output, semantic key, and pressure | Orbit returns typed terminal or viewport outcomes without forbidden mutation and routes exact terminal input when required | Exact typed outcomes, revisions, and PTY bytes; semantic no-mutation and boundedness | `ORB-C8` |
| `conformance_c8_signed_scroll_batch_is_atomic_bounded_and_authoritative` | One large signed commit, both history edges, lagging and future authority, routing changes, synchronized output, selection, and pressure | Orbit performs one native viewport movement and returns one result with exact requested/applied rows, one frame, and the next preview | Exact result count, rows, revision, adjacent preview, PTY absence, and failure non-mutation | `ORB-C8` |
| `conformance_c9_selection_copy_is_authoritative_bounded_and_client_scoped` | Wide and combining text, viewport movement, reversed selection, detach, alternate-screen output, and resize | Selected presentation is client-scoped while finished copy stays frozen across later terminal mutations | Exact copied Unicode text; semantic selection visibility, scope, and freeze | `ORB-C9` |

A mismatch is classified from the smallest reproducer: an Orbit regression if
the adapter or ownership path changed, an upstream behavior change or defect if
only the pinned engine changed, an unsupported candidate capability in a
separately authorized engine spike, or a corpus expectation error when the
assertion exceeds the indexed contract. A mismatch does not broaden product
compatibility; product fixes and upstream submissions require their own
authorized work.

The inventory is the minimum test-only boundary a future candidate-engine spike
may consume: stimulus, Orbit-visible observation, and assertion policy. It does
not authorize a shared runtime trait, production adapter, second engine, public
trace, golden corpus, or dependency. External VT and Unicode certification
remains owned by `orb-vt-unicode-baselines-i32`; performance remains owned by
`orb-1sd`.

## Rules

- Each contract uses one `## ORB-CN — Name` heading and the required fields
  `Status`, `Consumer`, `Trigger`, `Result`, `Important failures`, `Owner`,
  `Boundary`, and `Proof`.
- Add optional `Consumes` and `Open proof` fields when applicable; nest
  `Environment` and `Evidence` under `Proof`, and use nested bullets instead of
  prose table cells.
- Contract IDs are stable and repository-qualified. Never renumber or reuse an
  ID; mark an explicitly removed contract retired.
- Only user-approved user-visible behavior, correctness boundaries, ownership
  invariants, and cross-repository interfaces receive contract IDs.
- Do not index functions, modules, dependencies, configuration literals,
  individual tests, or speculative future features.
- Every product implementation Bead names the contract IDs it creates, changes,
  proves, consumes, hardens, or preserves. If requested behavior has no indexed
  contract, stop for user approval before changing code or the index.
- The Bead's Reference gate records how evidence constrains the implementation;
  this index records the durable contract rather than duplicating research
  notes.
- Closing an implementation Bead updates the status, owner, checks, and gap for
  every affected contract.
- A `Proved` contract names the exact accepted proof-bearing commit. A later
  change to its owner or implementation surface reruns the indexed checks and
  advances that revision, or downgrades the status and records the gap.

## Consumer compatibility

A repository consuming Orbit records each contract ID and its exact accepted
proof revision. Boundary changes are classified as compatible or breaking and
name every known consumer and update order. A client does not hide an Orbit gap
behind an adapter, compatibility window, second decoder, or second source of
authority without an explicit user decision.

## Outside the initial index

Orbit's accepted long-term direction includes host-owned terminal-session state
and native, web, or mobile clients. Eon owns product workspace topology and
policy. Multiple sessions, windows, tabs, splits, restart recovery, remote
transport, web, mobile, and multiplayer are not initial Orbit contracts and
receive no IDs until the user authorizes their implementation scope. macOS
credibility is an architecture discipline rather than a claim of supported
behavior; actual macOS runtime support also receives no contract ID until the
user authorizes it.
