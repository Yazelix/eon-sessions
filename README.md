# Eon Sessions

Eon Sessions contains Orbit, the runtime that keeps a terminal process alive
after its client disconnects. Orbit owns the PTY, libghostty terminal state,
and local attachment protocol. [Eon Desktop](https://github.com/Yazelix/eon-desktop)
renders its frames; [Eon](https://github.com/Yazelix/eon) composes both projects.

## Demo

[Watch the scripted recording](https://github.com/Yazelix/eon/blob/a8e5874a31a3b7b27eaa754e8ad9a6d44cbb07c8/assets/demo/eon-demo.mp4) of the composed Linux alpha.

## Run locally

Orbit's server and diagnostic client are proved on x86_64 Linux and Apple
Silicon macOS. The composed Eon product remains Linux-only.

```sh
tic -x terminfo/eon.terminfo
cargo run --locked -- serve
```

In another terminal:

```sh
cargo run --locked -- client
```

The client can detach and reconnect while the server keeps the Session alive.
The default private socket is `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/yazelix-orbit/orbit.sock`, with a
per-user `/tmp` fallback. [Session lifecycle](docs/LIFECYCLE.md) explains
management, Stop, and shutdown limits.
